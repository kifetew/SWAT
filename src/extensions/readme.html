  <h1>Extending JabRef's export and import capabilities</h1>
  
  <h2>Custom exports</h2>
  
  <p>JabRef's export and import capabilities can be extended quite
  easily. Please unzip the JabRef-extensions file, preferably to the
  same folder where you installed JabRef (where the <code>jabref.jar</code> file can be found).
  </p>
  
  <p>To create your own export format, you can define <i>custom layouts</i>,
  simple templates where at certain places the contents of a JabRef database are written
  into. For an example see the files in the <a href="layout">layout directory</a>.
  For more details about creating your own export format, please read 
  <a href="API/CustomExports.html"><code>API/CustomExports.html</code></a>.</p>
  
  <p>The extensions contain also a few simple examples on how to create new <i>field formatters</i> -
  small commands that determine how database entries are written to your
  custom layout, please check <a href="net/sf/jabref/export/layout/format"><code>net/sf/export/layout/format</code></a>.  
  </p>
  
  <h2>Custom imports</h2>
  
  <p>You can also quite easily  create an importer that allows you
  to read references from sources important to you. This requires only
  modest programming skills. Please check the 
  <a href="SimpleCsvImporter.java">example</a>, compile it
  using the <code>compileAll.bat</code> script, register it
  as a custom importer with your JabRef-installation and
  import the <a href="SimpleCsvImporter.csv">SimpleCsvImporter.csv</a>
  file to see how it is done. More details can be found
  in <a href="API/CustomImports.html"><code>API/CustomImports.html</code></a>.</p>
  
  <p>All importers that are part of the standard JabRef-distribution are also
  included in this extensions-package under <a href="net/sf/jabref/imports"><code>net/sf/jabref/imports</code></a>. 
  In addition to serving as further examples, you can also fix them and register them as custom importers
  if you encounter any problems.
  </p>
  
  <h2>API documentation</h2>
  
  <p>The API-documentation for extensions that require some programming
  is available under <a href="API/index.html"><code>API/index.html</code></a>.

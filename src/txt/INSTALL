Quick instructions, compiling JabRef from source
------------------------------------------------

To compile JabRef from source, you need:

* A Java compiler, supporting Java 1.5 or higher.
* Jakarta Ant (http://ant.apache.org). Don't know what version is
  needed; the latest stable version should work fine.

To compile, use the command "ant jars".
After the build is finished, you can find the executable jar file
named "JabRef-$VERSION.jar" (where $VERSION is the current version of the
source tree) in the "build/lib" directory. Enjoy!

You can also build and run JabRef directly with the command "ant run".

On Mac OS X you should include the targets osx and osxjar,
making the correct command "ant compile unjarlib osx jars osxjar".
AFter the build is finished, you will find the OS X application
"JabRef.app" in the "build/lib" directory along with the executable
jar.

If you have the required libraries (found as jar files in the "lib"
directory in your classpath, you can remove the "unjarlib" target to
avoid these libraries being bundled inside the JabRef jar.

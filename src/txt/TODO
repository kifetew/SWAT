------
  * Think about synchronizing XMP.
  * Document data schema used (BibteXmp)
  * Add build.xml target to export standalone XMPUtil for the CLI.
  * Allow search relativ to bibtex-file
  * Plugin-System may crash...
  
Morten:

* Look into whether incremental search could be made more persistent when search panel loses focus.
* Fix handling of Jr particle in names.
* Problem: when looking at group with hiding non-hits, newly created entry doesn't appear in entry editor.
* Improve handling of SO field in CSA import (csaresults-12.txt).

* Plugins like SVN plugin might need hooks for performing actions before a database is
  closed, and may need the ability to cancel the closing, and to avoid questions about
  saving changes.

* Enable "Open spires entry" ("openSpires" action)? Think about better integration of this?
  Look into which viewer is used.
* Add "Copy all externally linked files for this set of entries"-feature.
  Basic functionality in AccessLinksForEntries.
* Problem setting today with Microba calendar.

* [MADE WORKAROUND] Native FileDialog does not work for selecting a directory.
  - workaround is to autodisable native file dialog for dir selection.

* [POSTPONE] Icon selection for external file types: - select arbitrary images from disk?
* [POSTPONE] Fix Save/Export file dialog stuff

  <h1>JStor search</h1>

    <p>The JStor search relies on the BibSonomy scraper project (http://scraper.bibsonomy.org/) to
    extract information from the JStor web page.</p>

    <p>The following help was taken from the JStor website and may change if JStor does:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You will be searching the author, title, and full-text of all types of journal content (articles, book reviews, etc.) by default</li>
      <li>Use quotation marks to search for a phrase (e.g., &quot;punctuated equilibrium&quot;)</li>
      <li>Use ti: to search for an article title, au: to search for an author (e.g., ti:&quot;two-person cooperative games&quot;, au:&quot;john nash&quot;)</li>
      <li>Use AND, OR, NOT to combine terms (e.g., ti:&quot;two-person cooperative games&quot; AND au:&quot;john nash&quot;)</li>
    </ul>

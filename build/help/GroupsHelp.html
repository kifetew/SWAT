<h1>Groups</h1>

    <p>Groups allow to structure a BibTeX database in a
    tree-like way that is similar to organizing files on disk in
    directories and subdirectories. The two main differences are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>While a file is always located in exactly one
        directory, an entry may be contained in more than one
        group.</li>

        <li>Groups may use certain criteria to dynamically define
        their content. New entries that match these criteria are
        automatically contained in these groups. This feature is
        not available in common file systems, but in several Email
        clients (e.g. Thunderbird and Opera).</li>
    </ul>Selecting a group shows the entries contained in that
    group. Selecting multiple groups shows the entries contained in
    any group (union) or those contained in all groups
    (intersection), depending on the current settings. All this is
    explained in detail below.

    <p>Group definitions are database-specific; they are saved as a
    <tt>@COMMENT</tt> block in the <tt>.bib</tt>-file and are
    shared among all users. (Future versions of JabRef might
    support user-dependent groups.)</p>

    <h2>Interface</h2>

    <p>The groups interface is shown in the side
    pane on the left of the screen. It can be toggled on or off by
    pressing <tt>CTRL-SHIFT-G</tt> or by the groups button in the
    toolbar. The interface has several buttons, but most functions
    are accessed via a context ("right-click") menu. Drag and Drop
    is also supported.</p>

    <table cellspacing="0"
           cellpadding="5"
           border="0"

                <h2>Some quick examples</h2>

                <p>You might want to...</p>

                <h3>...just create a group and assign some entries
                to it</h3>

                <p>Ensure that the groups interface is
                visible. Press the <b>New Group</b> button, enter a
                name for the group, then press OK, leaving all
                values at their defaults. Now select the entries to
                be assigned to the group and use Drag and Drop to
                the group, or the option <b>Add to group</b> in the
                context menu. Finally select the group to see its
                content (which should be the entries you just
                assigned).</p>

                <h3>...use the <tt>keywords</tt> field to group the
                entries</h3>

                <p>Ensure that the groups interface is
                visible. Press the <b>New Group</b> button, enter a
                name for the group, and select the option to
                dynamically group entries by searching a field for
                a keyword. Enter the keyword to search for, then
                click OK. Finally select the group to see its
                content (which should be all entries whose
                <tt>keywords</tt> field contains the keyword you
                specified).</p>

                <h3>...use a free-form search expression to define
                a group</h3>

                <p>Ensure that the groups interface is
                visible. Press the <b>New Group</b> button, enter a
                name for the group, and select the option to
                dynamically group entries by a free-form search
                expression. Enter <tt>author=smith</tt> as a search
                expression (replace <tt>smith</tt> with a name that
                actually occurs in your database) and click
                <b>OK</b>. Finally select the group to see its
                content (which should be all entries whose
                <tt>author</tt> field contains the name you
                specified).</p>

                <h3>...combine multiple groups</h3>

                <p>Create two
                different groups (e.g. as described above). Click
                the <b>Settings</b> button and make sure that
                <b>Union</b> is selected. Now select both groups.
                You should see all entries contained in any of the
                two groups. Click <b>Settings</b> again and select
                <b>Intersection</b>. Now you should see only those
                entries contained in both groups (which might be
                none at all, or exactly the same entries as before
                in case both groups contain the same entries).</p>

                <h3>...identify overlapping groups</h3>

                <p>JabRef allows you to easily identify groups that overlap
                with the currently selected groups (i.e. that
                contain at least one entry that is also contained
                in the currently selected groups). Click
                <b>Settings</b> and activate the option to
                highlight overlapping groups. Then select a group
                that overlaps with other groups. The other groups
                should be highlighted.</p>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Types of groups</h2>

    <p>In JabRef there are four different types of groups:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>The group <b>All Entries</b>, which -- as the name
        suggests -- contains all entries, is always present and
        cannot be edited or removed.</li>

        <li><b>Static groups</b> behave like directories on disk
        and contain only those entries that you explicitly assign
        to them.</li>

        <li><b>Dynamic groups based on keyword search</b> contain
        entries in which a certain BibTeX field (e.g.
        <tt>keywords</tt>) contains a certain keyword (e.g.
        <tt>electrical</tt>). This method does not require manual
        assignment of entries, but uses information that is already
        present in the database. If all entries in your database
        have suitable keywords in their <tt>keywords</tt> field,
        using this type of group might be the best choice.</li>

        <li><b>Dynamic groups based on free-form search
        expressions</b> contain entries that match a specified
        search expression, using the same syntax as the
        <a href="SearchHelp.html">search panel</a> on the side
        pane. This <a href="SearchHelp.html#advanced">syntax</a>
        supports logical operators (<tt>AND</tt>, <tt>OR</tt>,
        <tt>NOT</tt>) and allows to specify one or more BibTeX
        fields to search, facilitating more flexible group
        definitions than a keyword search (e.g. <tt>author=smith
        and title=electrical</tt>).</li>
    </ol>Every group that you create is of one of the last three
    types. The group editing dialog, which is invoked by
    double-clicking on a group, shows a short description of the
    selected/edited group in plain English.

    <h2>Groups structure, creating and removing groups</h2>

    <p>Just like directories, groups are structured like a tree, with the
    group <b>All Entries</b> at the root. By right-clicking on a
    group you can add a new group to the tree, either at the same
    level as the selected group or as a subgroup of it. The <b>New
    Group</b> button lets you create a new subgroup of the group
    <b>All Entries</b>, regardless of the currently selected
    group(s). The context menu also allows to remove groups and/or
    subgroups, to sort subgroups alphabetically, or to move groups
    to a different location in the tree. The latter can also be
    done by Drag and Drop, with the restriction that Drag and Drop
    does not support changing the order of a group's subgroups.</p>

    <p>Undo and redo is supported for all edits.</p>

    <h3>Static groups</h3>

    <p>Static groups are populated only by
    explicit manual assignment of entries. After creating a static
    group you select the entries to be assigned to it, and use
    either Drag and Drop or the main table's context menu to
    perform the assignment. To remove entries from a static group,
    select them and use the main table's context menu. There are no
    options to be configured.</p>

    <p>This method of grouping requires that all entries have a
    unique BibTeX key. In case of missing or duplicate BibTeX keys,
    the assignment of the affected entries cannot be correctly
    restored in future sessions.</p>

    <h3>Dynamic groups</h3>

    <p>The content of a dynamic group is
    defined by a logical condition. Only entries that meet this
    condition are contained in the group. This method uses the
    information stored in the database itself, and updates
    dynamically whenever the database changes.</p>

    <p>Two types of conditions can be used:</p>

    <dl>
        <dt><b>Searching a field for a keyword</b></dt>

        <dd>This method groups entries in which a specified BibTeX
        field (e.g. <tt>keywords</tt>) contains a specified search
        term (e.g. <tt>electrical</tt>). Obviously, for this to
        work, the grouping field must be present in every entry,
        and its content must be accurate. The above example would
        group all entries referring to something electrical. Using
        the field <tt>author</tt> allows to group entries by a
        certain author, etc. The search can either be done as a
        plain-text or a regular expression search. In the former
        case, JabRef allows to manually assign/remove entries
        to/from the group by simply appending/removing the search
        term to/from the content of the grouping field. This makes
        sense only for the <tt>keywords</tt> field or for
        self-defined fields, but obviously not for fields like
        <tt>author</tt> or <tt>year</tt>.</dd>

        <dt><b>Using a free-form search expression</b></dt>

        <dd>This is similar to the above, but rather than search a
        single field for a single search term, the
        <a href="SearchHelp.html#advanced">search expression
        syntax</a> can be used, which supports logical operators
        (<tt>AND</tt>, <tt>OR</tt>, <tt>NOT</tt>) and allows to
        search multiple BibTeX fields. For example, the search
        expression <tt>keywords=regression and not
        keywords=linear</tt> groups entries concerned with
        non-linear regression.</dd>
    </dl>In the groups view, dynamic groups are shown in
    <i>italics</i> by default. This can be turned off in the
    preferences (Options -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Groups, box "Show
    dynamic groups in italics").

    <h3>Hierarchical context</h3>

    <p>By default, a group is
    <b>independent</b> of its position in the groups tree: When
    selected, only the group's contents are shown. However,
    especially when using dynamic groups, it is often useful to
    define a subgroup that <b>refines its supergroup</b>, i.e.,
    when selected, entries contained in both groups are displayed.
    For example, create a supergroup containing entries with the
    keyword <tt>distribution</tt> and a subgroup containing entries
    with the keyword <tt>gauss</tt> that refines this supergroup.
    Selecting the subgroup now displays entries that match both
    conditions, i.e. are concerned with Gaussian distributions. By
    adding another refining subgroup for <tt>laplace</tt> to the
    original supergroup, the grouping can easily be extended. In
    the groups tree, refining groups have a special icon (this can
    be turned off in the preferences).</p>

    <p>The logical complement to a refining group is a group that
    <b>includes its subgroups</b>, i.e. when selected, not only the
    group's own entries, but also its subgroups' entries are shown.
    In the groups tree, this type of group has a special icon (this
    can be turned off in the preferences).</p>

    <h2>Viewing a group's entries, combining multiple
    groups</h2>

    <p>Selecting a group shows the entries contained in
    that group by highlighting them and, depending on the settings
    (accessible by clicking the <b>Settings</b> button), moving
    them to the top of the list and/or selecting them. These
    options are identical to those available for the regular
    search.</p>

    <p>When multiple groups are selected, either the union or the
    intersection of their content is shown, depending on the
    current settings. This allows to quickly combine multiple
    conditions, e.g. if you have a static group <tt>Extremely
    Important</tt> to which you assign all extremely important
    entries, you can view the extremely important entries in any
    other group by selecting both groups (this requires to have
    <b>Intersection</b> selected in the settings).</p>

    <h2>Groups and searching</h2>

    <p>When viewing the contents of the
    selected group(s), a search can be performed within these
    contents using the regular search facility.</p>

    <h2>Highlighting overlapping groups</h2>

    <p>The <b>Settings</b>
    button offers an option to highlight overlapping groups. If
    this is activated, upon selection of one or more groups, all
    groups that contain at least one of the entries contained in
    the currently selected group(s) are highlighted. This quickly
    identifies overlap between the groups' contents. You might, for
    example, create a group <tt>To Read</tt> that contains all
    entries which you plan to read. Now, whenever you select any
    group, the group <tt>To Read</tt> is highlighted if the
    selected group contains entries that you plan to read.</p>

    <h2>Advanced features</h2>

    <p>After mastering the grouping concepts
    described above, the following advanced features might come in
    handy.</p>

    <h3>Automatically creating dynamic groups</h3>

    <p>By clicking the
    <b>Automatically create groups for database</b> button, you can
    quickly create a set of groups appropriate for your database.
    This feature will gather all words found in a specific field of
    your choice, and create a group for each word. This is useful
    for instance if your database contains suitable keywords for
    all entries. By autogenerating groups based on the
    <tt>keywords</tt> field, you should have a basic set of groups
    at no cost.</p>

    <p>You can also specify characters to ignore, for instance
    commas used between keywords. These will be treated as
    separators between words, and not part of them. This step is
    important for combined keywords such as <tt>laplace
    distribution</tt> to be recognized as a single semantic unit.
    (You cannot use this option to remove complete words. Instead,
    delete the unwanted groups manually after they were created
    automatically.)</p>

    <h3>Refreshing the groups view</h3>

    <p>The <b>Refresh</b> button
    updates the entry table to reflect the current groups
    selection. This is usually done automatically, but in rare
    occasions (e.g. after a group-related undo/redo) a manual
    refresh is required.</p>

    <h3>Mixing refining groups with including groups</h3>

    <p>If a refining group is a subgroup of a group that includes its
    subgroups -- the refining group's siblings --, these siblings
    are ignored when the refining group is selected.</p>

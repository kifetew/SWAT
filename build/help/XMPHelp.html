    <h1>XMP metadata support in JabRef</h1>

    <p>XMP is a standard created by Adobe Systems for storing
    metadata (data about data) in files. An well known example for
    metadata are MP3 tags, which can be used to describe artist,
    album and song name of a MP3 file. Adding metadata to MP3 helps
    other people to identify the songs correctly independent of
    file-name and can provide means for software (MP3 players for
    instance) to sort and group songs.</p>

    <p>With XMP-support the JabRef team tries to bring the
    advantages of metadata to the world of reference managers. You
    can now choose to "Write XMP" metadata in the General Tab of
    JabRef, which will put all the Bibtex information into the PDF.
    If you then email this PDF to a collegue she can just drag the
    file into JabRef and all information that you entered will be
    available to her.</p>

    <h2>Usage</h2>

    <p>To use the XMP-feature in JabRef you can do the
    following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>To <b>import a single annotated PDF-file</b> that
        contains XMP you can select "File -&gt; Import into...
        -&gt; XMP-annotated PDF" or drag the file into the main
        view.</li>

        <li>To <b>write the bibliographic information to the
        associated PDF</b> do the following: Double click the entry
        in the main view, go to the "General" tab and click on
        "Write XMP".</li>

        <li>If you want <b>to annotate all the PDFs in a given
        database</b> you can select "Tools -&gt; Write XMP for
        database"</li>

        <li>To verify if it worked you can open the PDF in Adobe
        Acrobat and select "File -&gt; Document Properties -&gt;
        Additional Metadata -&gt; Advanced". In the tree to the
        right you should see an entry called
        "http://purl.org/net/bibteXMP". This works only with Adobe
        Acrobat, not with Adobe Reader.</li>

        <li>If you don't have Adobe Acrobat, you can use
        <i>pdfinfo</i> instead in order to see the XMP metadata.
        <i>pdfinfo</i> is part of Xpdf
        (<code>www.foolabs.com/xpdf</code>) and Poppler
        (<code>http://poppler.freedesktop.org</code>).</li>

                <h2>BibteXmp Fileformat</h2>

                <p>XMP uses a subset of the Resource Description
                Framework (RDF) to store data. For JabRef a new
                metadata format is used which maps very closely to
                BibTeX. Basically all fields and values are turned
                into nodes of an XML document. Only authors and
                editors are stored as rdf:Seq-structures, so users
                of the data can skip the splitting on 'and's. All
                strings and crossrefs will be resolved in the
                data.</p>

                <p>The following easy minimal schema is used:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The BibTeX-key is stored as
                    <code>bibtexkey</code>.</li>

                    <li>The type of the BibTeX-entry is stored as
                    <code>entrytype</code>.</li>

                    <li><code>author</code> and <code>editor</code>
                    are encoding as <code>rdf:Seq</code>s where the
                    individual authors are represented as
                    <code>rdf:li</code>s.</li>

                    <li>All other fields are saved using their
                    field-name as is.</li>
                </ul><br />
                <br />


                <p>The following is an example of the mapping</p>

                <p>Beware of the following caveats if you trying to
                parse bibteXMP:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>In RDF attribute-value pairs can also be
                    expressed as nodes and vice versa.</li>
                </ul><br />

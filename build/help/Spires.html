    <h1>Spires search</h1>

    <p>The spires search function merely passes your search queries onto the Spires web search, so you should build your queries in the same way, except omitting the <em>find</em> or <em>fin</em> command. This help page will only give a brief introduction to the search queries. More extensive help on searching Spires can be found on the page http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/hep/help/index.shtml.</p>

    <p>Your query can be composed of several parts, combined using <em>and</em> and <em>or</em> as
    logical operators. Each part is composed of a letter or word indicating the type of field to search,
    followed by a space and the text to search for.</p>

    <p>The following list shows some of the field indicators that can be used:
    <ul>
        <li><em>a</em> or <em>author</em>: search author names</li>
        <li><em>t</em> or <em>title</em>: search in title</li>
        <li><em>j</em>: journal. Here either the common abbreviation or the 5 letter CODEN abbreviation for
        a journal can be used. Volume and page can also be included, separated by commas. For instance,
        <em>j Phys. Rev.,D54,1</em> looks in the journal Phys. Rev., volume D54, page 1.</li>
        <li><em>k</em>: search in keywords</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Example queries:
    <ul>
        <li><em>a smith and a jones</em>: search for references with authors "smith" and "jones"</li>
        <li><em>a smith or a jones</em>: search for references with either author "smith" or author "jones"</li>
        <li><em>a smith and not t processor</em>: search for author "smith" and omit references with "processor" in the title</li>
    </ul>
</p>

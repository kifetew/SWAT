    <h1>Field content selector</h1>

    <p>This feature allows you to store
    a selection of often-used words or phrases that you use often
    in your database. By default it is enabled for the fields
    <em>Journal</em>, <em>Author</em>, <em>Keywords</em> and
    <em>Publisher</em>, but you can also add selectors to other
    fields, in the upper part of the <em>Manage</em> dialog (menu
    <strong>Tools --&gt; Manage content selectors</strong>).</p>

    <p>The word selection is database-specific, and is saved along
    with your references in the .bib file.</p>

    <p>To add a new word, you can simply write it into the selector
    combo box and press Enter. Using the <em>Manage</em> dialog you
    can also remove words that you have added.</p>

  title = {Goal-Directed Requirements Acquisition},
  journal = {Science of Computer Programming},
  year = {1993},
  volume = {20},
  pages = {3-50},
  number = {1-2},
  abstract = {Requirements analysis includes a preliminary acquisition step where
	a global model for the specification of the
	
	system and its environment is elaborated. This model, called requirements
	model, involves concepts that are currently
	
	not supported by existing formal specification languages, such as
	goals to be achieved, agents to be assigned,
	
	alternatives to be negotiated, etc. The paper presents an approach
	to requirements acquisition which is driven by such
	
	higher-level concepts. Requirements models are acquired as instances
	of a conceptual meta-model. The latter can be
	
	represented as a graph where each node captures an abstraction such
	as, e.g., goal, action, agent, entity, or event, and
	
	where the edges capture semantic links between such abstractions.
	Well-formedness properties on nodes and links
	
	constrain their instances - that is, elements of requirements models.
	Requirements acquisition processes then
	
	correspond to particular ways of traversing the meta-model graph to
	acquire appropriate instances of the various
	
	nodes and links according to such constraints. Acquisition processes
	are governed by strategies telling which way to
	
	follow systematically in that graph; at each node specific tactics
	can be used to acquire the corresponding instances.
	
	The paper describes a significant portion of the meta-model related
	to system goals, and one particular acquisition
	
	strategy where the meta-model is traversed backwards from such goals.
	The meta-model and the strategy are
	
	illustrated by excerpts of a university library system.},

	founded on two key features: (i) the notions of agent, goal, plan

	the software development process; and (ii) a crucial role is assigned

	to its intended environment. This paper provides a (first) detailed
	account of the
	
	Tropos methodology. In particular, we describe the basic concepts
	on which Tropos
	
	is founded and the types of models one builds out of them. We also
	specify
	
	the analysis process through which design flows from external to system
	actors
	
	through a goal analysis and delegation. In addition, we provide an
	abstract syntax
	
	for Tropos diagrams and other linguistic constructs.},
